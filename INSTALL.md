**Plugin won't load?**
- Make sure you ran `npm install` and `npm run build`
- Check that `dist/code.js` and `dist/ui.js` exist

**Import takes too long?**
- This is normal for 1,000+ icons
- Close other plugins during import
- Be patient - it's worth the wait!

**Icons look wrong?**
- Icons are stroked by default (not filled)
- Change the stroke color in Figma's design panel
- Make sure stroke weight is set to 2 for best appearance
